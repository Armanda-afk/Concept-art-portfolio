<p align="center">
An old, abandoned ship repurposed by a mysterious traveler into a makeshift home. Inspired by the Tangle Shore aesthetic from Destiny, the concept explores improvised living spaces, scavenged technology, and the eerie beauty of a vessel reclaimed by time and ingenuity.
</p>

### Main base

    A once-thriving base, now destroyed after its core was activated, unleashing catastrophic energy throughout the facility. The concept focuses on depicting structural collapse, environmental damage, and the aftermath of a high-tech core meltdown.
